<h2>Rosedale</h2>

<p>The Rosedale neighborhood was farm and dairy land in the 1860s and in the 1900s was known for the nurseries and florists in the area. Most of the housing stock in this neighborhood was built during the 1930s and 1940s, although since the neighborhood is not protected by a NCCD or a Neighborhood Plan, many homes are today being remodeled with modern styling. </p>

This neighborhood is primarily made up of single family homes, but the corridors along Burnet Road and N. Lamar Blvd are almost exclusively commercial. </p>
