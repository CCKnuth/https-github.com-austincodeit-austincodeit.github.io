<p>District C5 is in Austin, roughly bounded by Research Blvd. on the southwest, Lamar Blvd. on the east, and Rutland Dr. on the north. It includes part of areas between Metric Blvd and Burnet Rd at south of West Braker Lane. The US Census Bureau estimates its 2015 population at 17,600, 80% of the population lives in rental units. About 70% of the populations is under the age of 40. About 40% of the annual household income is less than $25,000, and 30% have annual household income between $25,000 and $50,000. About 55% of the population is white and 35% are Biracial and others. </p>

<p>District C5 is characterized by well-established single family and duplex neighborhoods flanked by large multifamily housing units on the main arterials of Rundberg and Lamar, and industrial uses along Metric and Research Boulevard – which serves as the frontage road for US 183. Part of the district was once the town of Fiskville, which was annexed by Austin in the mid-1960s. With annexation came interim zoning regulation and a flurry of land use regulations that overlapped and led to sprawled growth throughout the area.

As Austin expanded, homesteaders and small-scale farms in the area sold their land to developers throughout the 1970s and 1980s resulting in the many office parks and subdivisions present today. Rapid highway construction has also affected the district. Research Boulevard became a freeway in 2002, and Lamar serves as a key north-south arterial for the city.
