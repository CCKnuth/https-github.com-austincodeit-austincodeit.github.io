<p> District C14 is located in central South Austin. Its boundaries lie east of IH-35, north of East Ben White Blvd. (and US Hwy 290 and TX Hwy71), south of Colorado River, and west of Montopolis Drive.  It includes Riverside, East Riverside-Oltorf, Parker Lane and Pleasant Valley neighborhoods. The Parker Lane, Pleasant Valley, and Riverside neighborhoods comprise the East Riverside/Oltorf Combined (EROC) planning area. </p>

<p> The 2015 population estimate for District C14 was about 40,000. 90% of 16,700 housing units are renter-occupied. 40% of the residents are in their twenties and 20% are in their thirties. 20% of the household annual income is less than $15,000 while another 20% is between 35,000 and $50,000. 70% are white, 15% are biracial and 10% are blacks. </p>

<p> Multifamily residential is the predominant land use for the East Riverside/Oltorf Combined area; most notably, Riverside whose land use is over one third multifamily.  The prevailing land use in Parker Lane is single family residential, while the Pleasant Valley has more open space (35%) than multifamily and single family residential combined. </p>

<p> All three areas experienced increases in gross density from 1990 to 2000 as did the Urban Core (refer to figure on following page). Riverside (745 acres) had three times as many people per acre as the Parker Lane, Pleasant Valley or the urban core.  This high number (21.82) is due in part to the fact that over one third of the land use in Riverside is multifamily residential. In contrast, Pleasant Valley (which has double the acreage of Riverside), had the lowest gross density per acre (6.0) in 2000.  Contributing factors to this low gross density include the presence of the Roy G. Guerrero Colorado River Park, the 18-hole Riverside Golf Course, the Austin Community College (ACC) Riverside Campus, and a sizable industrial park district. </p>
