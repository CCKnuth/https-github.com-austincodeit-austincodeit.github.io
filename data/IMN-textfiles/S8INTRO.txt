<p> In 1960, the Dove Springs and Franklin Park subdivisions were platted, with the bulk of the houses built in the 1970s. The areas around Peppertree Pkwy and Dove Springs Road were first to develop, with territories north of Teri Road following suit. </p>

<p> The city gradually annexed southeast Austin in a series of small annexations during the 1970s and 1980s. Also in the 1980s, the Southeast Corner Alliance of Neighbors (SCAN) formed to respond to growing crime and gang problems in the Dove Springs area. By the mid-1990s, residents of the greater Dove Springs area had organized their own targeted efforts. This helped reverse the trend of crime and gang violence and provided outlets for the abundant youth population. The neighbors also gained tools to help families purchase their homes and encourage better maintenance of properties throughout the Southeast area.
