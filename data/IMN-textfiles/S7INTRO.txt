<p> One of the first suburban developments in the Westgate area was the Western Trails subdivision, built in 1956. Besides the Western Trails subdivision, there was limited residential development in the Westgate and Garrison Park neighborhoods in the early 1960s. </p>

<p> By the end of the 1960s, development had spread throughout the Westgate area and into the Garrison Park area along Manchaca Road. When Crockett High School opened in 1968 at the intersection of Manchaca Road and Stassney Lane, the only other development in the area was a two-story farmhouse on Manchaca Road. By the 1980s, most of the present day residential and commercial development in the area had occurred. </p>

<p> Bike lanes are installed on some streets such as include Stassney Lane, Berkeley Avenue, and Emerald Forest Drive, but not on others such as Westgate Boulevard, William Cannon Drive, South 1st, and Manchaca Rd. The sidewalk network is also largely complete along major roadways; however, along residential streets there are sidewalks on only one side of the street, significant gaps in the sidewalk network, and on many residential streets there are no sidewalks. </p>
