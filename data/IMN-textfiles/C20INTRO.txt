<p> District C20 is located in north central Austin. It borders on 38th Street and part of West 45th Street to the south, North Lamar and part Woodrow Ave to the west, West Koenig Lane and part Northloop Blvd to the north, and IH-35 and part of Duval Street to the east. This district is characterized by the neighborhoods of North Loop and the Triangle State, along with the established and recognized historic neighborhood of Hyde Park. The entire district is characterized by a large percentage of students, and young professionals affiliated with the University of Texas, especially in the Hyde Park neighborhood. </p>

<p> The 2015 US Census Bureau's American Community Survey estimated its population at 13,000. 75% of its 6500 housing units are renter-occupied. More than 40% of the residents are in their twenties, 20% are in their thirties, while 15% are in their forties. About 15% residents’ annual household income is between $50,000 and $75,000, while about 20% are below $15,000. About 85% are white and 10% are biracial. </p>

<h2>Hyde Park</h2>

<p> Hyde Park was created as a master planned streetcar-suburb in 1891, far from the core of the city which emphasized large trees, wide sidewalks, for upper-class clientele. During the 1960s, the rapid growth of the University of Texas increased the demand for housing and rental property in the area. The decline of some of the neighborhood's older homes made it a prime target for demolition and removal, and building new apartment complexes. The Hyde Park Neighborhood Association was formed in 1974. </p>

<p> Hyde Park is a member of the National Historic Registry, as well as a City of Austin NCCD (Neighborhood Conservation Combining District) -- a zoning overlay "intended to preserve and protect older neighborhoods by allowing modifications to applicable regulations in accordance with a neighborhood plan for development and conservation." This has resulted in a marked difference in the built environment between Hyde Park and other parts of this district. </p>

<h2>North Loop</h2>

<p> This neighborhood is approximately 5 miles north of the downtown area. Within the North Loop Neighborhood Planning Area there are three active Neighborhood Associations. These are Northfield, Morningside-Ridgetop, and Eye 35/Airport Blvd. The closure of the Robert Mueller Airport in 1999 not only increased the quality of life of neighborhood residents by eliminating noise and other impacts; but the closure has contributed to the North Loop area becoming a more attractive and sought-after location.</p>

<p> North Loop is often referred to as a neighborhood in "transition." The neighborhood prides itself on a "funky" character, but is becoming increasingly upscale, with homes in the neighborhood selling for as high as $800,000. </p>
