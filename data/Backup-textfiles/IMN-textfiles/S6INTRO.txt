<p> The S6 District is primarily bound by the Union Pacific Railroad to the east, Mopac Blvd (Loop-1 or Texas-1) to the west, William Cannon Drive to the north, and Davis Lane to the South. The Stephenson Nature Preserve and Outdoor Education Center, Longview Neighborhood Park, Davis Hill Neighborhood Park, Piney Bend Park and Goat Cave Karst Nature Preserve takes up a significant portion of the district. The Goat Cave Preserve was set aside to buffer some of the ecologically sensitive karsts in the area from the housing that is surrounding it more and more. Karsts are caves that feed directly into the Edwards Aquifer below ground. This cave serves as the home of a colony of bats and the city has started to take steps to restore the karst to a healthy environment for them. </p>
