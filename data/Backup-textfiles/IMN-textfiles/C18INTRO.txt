<p> District C18's western and northern boundaries varies. It lies one part east of east of Mopac Expressway or Texas Loop 1 and south of Westover Road, another part is east of North Lamar and south of West 38th Street, and yet another part east of Duval Street and south of East 45th Street.  Most of this district is west of IH-35 and north of West Martin Luther King Jr Blvd. One part is north of Enfield Road at west of North Lamar Blvd.  This district contains the campus of University of Texas at Austin, Texas Memorial Stadium, St David’s medical Center, Eastwoods Park and Wading Pool, Hancock Golf Course, Adams-Hemphill Park, and Pease District Park. Shoal Creek Greenbelt runs through this district. It includes these neighborhood planning areas:  Hancock, West University, North University, Central West Austin, Judge's Hill and the Drag – Guadalupe Street. </p>

<p> More than 50% of the district population of 37,500 is in their twenties and 30% is less than twenty. 45% of residents’ annual household income is less than $15,000 and 20% annual household income is between $35,000 and $75,000. 80% of 100,600 housing units are renter-occupied. 75% of them are White and 15% are Asians.

<h2>Hancock</h2>
<p> During the 1990s, the population of the Hancock Neighborhood Planning Area grew by a significant 15.5%. This increase is notable because few new noteworthy multi-family projects were developed during that time and most of the population increase was absorbed by the existing housing or by modest additions to the existing housing stock. The primary destination in this neighborhood is the Hancock shopping center. The retail center provides services such as a supermarket, pet store, and department store for surrounding areas. </p>

<h2>North University</h2>
<p> Although this neighborhood is largely single-family homes, garage apartments began appearing in the mid-1920s. Numerous two-story apartments were constructed during the last half of the twentieth century, eliminating the last of the undeveloped lots as well as some the older houses. </p>
<p> This neighborhood is predominantly White, and Asians are the largest minority group in the neighborhood. However, Hispanic and Other populations are growing in the neighborhood. University of Texas students makeup the majority of this neighborhood. </p>

<h2>West University</h2>
<p> West University has an even higher concentration of UT students than North University. Apartments and condominiums have been added in recent years to the housing mix (replacing many of the houses on San Gabriel Street, Leon Street, and Robbins Place). </p>

<h2>Central West Austin</h2>
<p> Central West Austin is primarily urban with most development close to environmental features and, in some cases, within the flood plain. This is because the neighborhood developed before environmental regulations were enacted or enforced. </p> 

<p> Central West Austin’s growth from 1990 to 2000 came largely through the addition of about 600 households, some of which was added when 256 units were added for The Gables at the Brackenridge Tract. During this time, the average size of households remained about the same. </p>

<p> Central West Austin is less diverse than Austin as a whole. Around 80% of neighborhood residents are White. The middle-aged population in the neighborhood recently experienced significant growth. The substantial growth in those aged 45 to 54 suggests that middle-aged residents are staying; the decline in those aged 35 to 44 suggests that younger residents, though they live in the neighborhood in great numbers, are less prone to stay. Additionally, rising home prices could be driving younger residents out. </p>
